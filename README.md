# Personal / CV Site
Just your run-of-the-mill static site hosted on Github Pages.  This particular site was build with [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/).

The design was heavily inspired by Devfolio by [Cruip](https://cruip.com/).

As for the structure of this project, credit there goes to an article by [Jason at Fly.io](https://fly.io/phoenix-files/crafting-your-own-static-site-generator-using-phoenix/)
